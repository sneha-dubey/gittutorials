        "\n",
        "b.)Efficiency: Regular expressions are highly optimized for speed and efficiency, and can often perform text matching and manipulation tasks much faster than using standard string methods.\n",

        "c.)Reusability: Once you have created a regular expression pattern, you can reuse it in multiple contexts to match and manipulate text that has a similar pattern. \n",
