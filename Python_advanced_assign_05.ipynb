        "However, multiple inheritance can also lead to conflicts, such as ambiguity in cases where two parent classes have methods with the same name. To resolve this, some programming languages have adopted alternative solutions, such as mixins or interfaces, to provide similar functionality without the issues associated with multiple inheritance."

This is often accomplished through the use of object composition, where one object contains or is composed of one or more other objects. The containing object, known as the delegate, delegates certain responsibilities and behaviors to its contained objects.\n",

In this way, composition provides a way to combine the behaviors and characteristics of multiple classes into a single, more complex class. This allows for more flexible and reusable code, as well as a better organization of code into smaller, more manageable units. Unlike inheritance, which creates a new class based on an existing class, composition allows multiple classes to be combined in a more dynamic and flexible way, providing greater control over the relationships between classes."
